All icons in the theme are using a font that is FontAwesome.


Based on the provisions that have been written in

http://blog.themeforest.net/general/font-licensing-for-the-web/

the ThemeForest author cannot include the font in the theme package.


So please download the font here : 

https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/zipball/master


After download zip file, unzip it and click on "font" folder. Copy (below names) four files and upload in theme's "../fonts/"folder.
